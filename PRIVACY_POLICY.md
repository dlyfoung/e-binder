## E-Binder: Privacy policy

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed the E-Binder application to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by users is stored locally on the device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.
