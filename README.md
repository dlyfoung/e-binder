# Welcome to I-Worship

I-Worship is an mobile application to help churches to access resources quickly (such as lyrics). The documents can be loaded via a Google document. The import function will load a page as an entry using the first line as "title."

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

To test the application, you can use the `expo` mobile app or use an emulator (see [Android iOS Emulator extension in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DiemasMichiels.emulate))


## Project structure

The project uses React native with [`gluestack-ui`'s components](https://gluestack.io).

* `/app` contains the application code.
* `/components/ui/iworship` contains the custom components used by the application code.


To lint and format code, use:

   ```bash
    npm run lint
   ```
